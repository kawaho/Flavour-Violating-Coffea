# Flavour-Violating-Coffea
This is a repository to run LFV H -> e + mu analysis with Coffea
# Setup
Create a cvmfs-based portable virtual env and install Coffea
```bash
source setup.sh
```
If you experienced problems with cvmfs (e.g. plot1d() is intolorantly slow), use the cvmfs independent script instead
```bash
source setup_noCVMFS.sh
```
